## 💡 What Is ExForge?

ExForge is a **fully autonomous lead generation pipeline**. You point it at a niche and a city. It finds small businesses on Google Maps, visits their websites, identifies real problems, writes a personalized audit report as a PDF, and sends a cold email with the report attached — all without you touching anything.

```
You set the niche → ExForge does everything else
```

No manual prospecting. No copy-paste emails. No generic templates.
Every email references **specific issues found on that business's actual website.**

**Proven in production** — ran live targeting local businesses across multiple cities and niches. Generated real PDFs, email drafts, and sent 64+ cold emails autonomously.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1 — Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shahan24h/exforge.git
cd exforge
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium
```

### Step 2 — Create Your `.env` File

```bash
copy .env.example .env      # Windows
cp .env.example .env        # Mac/Linux
```

Open `.env` and fill in your credentials:

```env
# ── Anthropic ──────────────────────────────────────────
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here

# ── Email (SMTP) ───────────────────────────────────────
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=you@youragency.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password       # Gmail: use App Password, not your account password
FROM_NAME=Your Name / Agency Name

# ── IMAP (for tracking replies) ────────────────────────
IMAP_HOST=imap.gmail.com
IMAP_USER=you@youragency.com
IMAP_PASSWORD=your-app-password

# ── Target ─────────────────────────────────────────────
TARGET_NICHE=restaurants              # Any business type — restaurants, dentists, plumbers, etc.
TARGET_LOCATION=Brooklyn, New York    # Any city, anywhere in the world
MAX_LEADS_PER_RUN=20                  # How many to process per run
MIN_AI_SCORE=6                        # Only proceed with leads scoring 6+
```

> 💡 **Gmail users:** Go to [myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) and generate an App Password. Use that as both `SMTP_PASSWORD` and `IMAP_PASSWORD`.

### Step 3 — Run It

```bash
python main.py
```

That's it. ExForge handles the rest.

---

## ⌨️ All Commands

```bash
# ── Full Pipeline ───────────────────────────────────────────────
python main.py                    # Run the complete pipeline

# ── Individual Modules ─────────────────────────────────────────
python main.py --scrape-only      # Only scrape Google Maps → saves CSVs
python main.py --audit-only       # Only audit already-scraped leads
python main.py --report-only      # Only generate PDF reports
python main.py --email-only       # Only send pending email drafts

# ── Utilities ──────────────────────────────────────────────────

# ── Windows Automation ─────────────────────────────────────────
run_exforge.bat                   # Double-click or add to Task Scheduler
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 🗺️ Step 1 — Google Maps Scraper (`scraper/maps_scraper.py`)

Playwright opens a headless Chromium browser and searches Google Maps for your `TARGET_NICHE` + `TARGET_LOCATION`. For each result it extracts:

- Business name, address, phone number
- Website URL
- Google rating & review count

Results are saved as **timestamped CSV files** in `data/` like:
```
data/restaurants_Brooklyn_NewYork_20260414_090000.csv
```

You can run multiple search terms automatically to maximize coverage — for example targeting `restaurants`, `cafes`, and `diners` in the same city in a single run.

---

### 🤖 Step 2 — AI Shortlister (`shortlister/shortlist.py`)

Each lead from the CSVs is sent to **Claude Haiku** which assigns a score from **1–10**:

- Is it a local independent business (not a chain or franchise)?
- Does it have a website that could realistically be improved?
- Does the niche typically value online presence?

Leads scoring **below `MIN_AI_SCORE`** (default: 6) are skipped. All results are stored in **`data/leads.db`** — SQLite prevents the same business from ever being processed twice.

---

### 🔍 Step 3 — Website Auditor (`auditor/audit.py`)

Playwright visits each shortlisted business website and checks:

| Check | What It Looks For |
|---|---|
| 🔒 HTTPS | Is the site using a secure connection? |
| 📝 Meta Title | Is a title tag present and well-written? |
| 📋 Meta Description | Is a description tag present? |
| 📱 Mobile Viewport | Does the site declare a responsive viewport? |
| 🖼️ Image Alt Text | Do images have accessibility labels? |
| ⚡ Load Time | How long does the page take to fully load? |
| 📧 Contact Email | Extracts any visible email from the site |

A **full-page screenshot** is saved to `data/screenshots/` as a PNG:
```
data/screenshots/Joes_Pizza.png
data/screenshots/Brooklyn_Plumbing_Co.png
```

---

### 📄 Step 4 — Report Generator (`reporter/report_generator.py`)

A professional PDF audit report is generated per business using `reportlab` and saved to `data/reports/`:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   [Business Name] — Website Audit Report   │
│   Generated by [Your Agency Name]          │
├────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│   Overall Grade:  D                        │
├────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│   Issues Found:                            │
│    ✗  No HTTPS — site is not secure        │
│    ✗  Missing meta description             │
│    ✗  No mobile responsive design          │
│    ✗  12 images missing alt text           │
│    ✗  Page load time: 8.2 seconds          │
├────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│   Estimated Revenue Impact:                │
│    $3,200 – $8,400 / year                  │
├────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  [Live Screenshot of Their Website]        │
│                                            │
│  Ready to fix this? Reply for a quote.     │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

### ✉️ Step 5 — Email Composer (`emailer/compose.py`)

The audit data is sent to **Claude Haiku** which writes a short, personalized cold email. Each draft is saved as a `.txt` file in `data/drafts/` before sending:

```
data/drafts/Joes_Pizza_draft.txt
data/drafts/Brooklyn_Plumbing_Co_draft.txt
```

The email references the business by name and mentions **2–3 specific issues** found during the audit — no templates, no generic copy.

**Example output:**

```
Subject: Quick note about Joe's Pizza's website

Hi,

I came across Joe's Pizza while searching for restaurants in Brooklyn
and ran a quick audit on your site.

A few things stood out — the site isn't loading over HTTPS, there's
no mobile layout (most searches happen on phones), and the page takes
over 7 seconds to load which typically costs a significant share of
visitors before they see your menu.

I've attached a short report with the full details.

Happy to chat if you'd like — no obligation.

Best,
[Your Name] · [Agency Name]
```

---

### ✅ Step 6 — Approval Gate (`approvals/approval_gate.py`)

An **optional human review step** before emails go out. Run the approval gate to review each draft and PDF before sending — useful when targeting a new niche or city for the first time.

To skip the approval gate and send automatically, configure `AUTO_APPROVE=true` in `.env`.

---

### 📬 Step 7 — Email Sender (`emailer/send.py`)

Sends the composed email via SMTP using your business email address, with the PDF audit report attached. Each sent lead is marked in `leads.db` so it is **never contacted again**.

## 🌍 Changing Your Target

Edit these lines in `.env`:

```env
TARGET_NICHE=restaurants
TARGET_LOCATION=Brooklyn, New York
```

**Niches that work well:**

```
Local Services       →  plumbers · electricians · landscapers · cleaners
Food & Hospitality   →  restaurants · cafes · bakeries · catering
Health & Wellness    →  dentists · chiropractors · gyms · therapists
Professional         →  law firms · accountants · real estate agents
Beauty               →  barbershops · nail salons · hair salons · spas
```

Any **local, independent business** with an outdated website is a valid target.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] **Follow-up sequence** — automated 7-day follow-up email for non-replies
- [ ] **Web dashboard** — view pipeline status, sent emails, and reply tracking in browser
- [ ] **Docker deployment** — containerized for 24/7 VPS/Linux hosting
- [ ] **LinkedIn outreach** — parallel channel alongside email
- [ ] **Lighthouse integration** — deep performance scoring per audit

---
